Thank you for choosing to download and try my open source multitasking app. this app is
intended to improve workflow by opening a set group of apps with a single button click.

upon closing OpenAll a save.txt file will be created containing the list of previously set apps.
at this time there is not a function for removing an individual app, instead
you must open the save.txt file and remove the app from the file as well as the corresponding ","

i hope to gain the knowledge in the future of how to add this feature, but for now it is what it is.
